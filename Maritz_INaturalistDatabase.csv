Consternation; the snake has not been seen to escape but it has disappeared, some minutes later discovered hiding behind the rear light fitting of my truck - it had obviously headed for the nearest cover, but it was well wedged in and pretty inaccessible.  The would-be killers, ignoring my pleas to let it live tried poking and cajoling the snake out (a big  Boomslang by the way) which only resulted in upsetting the creature which then proceeded to hiss and squeeze in more tightly.  Time to go I thought so saying farewell to the disappointed hunters I drove off a km down the road, pulled over and wondered what to do next - I have enough pets, I didn't really need a +/-1.2m Boomslang in my yard.  The branch under the truck was a vain attempt to encourage snake to depart, 45 mins no progress except the tail had relaxed a little and a loop was hanging down; sun setting; salvation arrived in the form of a local contract, and acquaintance, who was passing; his mate confidently found a long stout stick and set about carefully loosening a loop of snake, the first attempt brought out 50 cm of tail which was rapidly withdrawn but made another thicker loop available, once the snake decided to flee the security of the truck it MOVED, so even though the I had the camera ready I nearly missed getting a shot.
